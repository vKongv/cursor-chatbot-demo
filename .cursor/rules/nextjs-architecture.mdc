## Next.js 15 App Router Conventions

- App Directory: Core structure using file-based routing.
- Components: Default to React Server Components (RSC). Use `'use client'` directive for Client Components only when necessary (hooks, event handlers).
- Data Fetching: Use `async` Server Components for server-side data fetching.
- Mutations/RPC: Prefer Server Actions (`actions.ts`) co-located with features over traditional API Routes for form submissions and direct client-to-server calls.
- Routing: Leverage Route Groups `(group_name)` for organization (e.g., `(auth)`, `(chat)`).
- Layouts: Use `layout.tsx` for shared UI structures.
