## Styling with Tailwind CSS

- Approach: Use Tailwind's utility classes directly in components for styling.
- Configuration: Theme customizations (colors, spacing, etc.) are defined in `tailwind.config.ts`.
- Base Styles: Global styles and base resets are in `app/globals.css`.
- Class Management: Use `clsx` for conditional class logic and ensure `tailwind-merge` (via `cn` utility in `lib/utils.ts`) is used to resolve conflicts.
- Linting/Sorting: Code style tools (Biome/ESLint) are configured to sort Tailwind classes automatically.
