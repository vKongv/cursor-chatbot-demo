## API & Server Action Guidelines

- API Routes (`app/**/api/`):
  - Use for traditional RESTful endpoints, especially streaming responses (e.g., `/api/chat`).
  - Suitable for webhooks or external integrations.
- Server Actions (`actions.ts`):
  - Preferred for RPC-style calls directly from RSCs/Client Components (forms, button clicks).
  - Co-locate actions with the features they serve.
- Validation: Use `zod` for validating request inputs and defining response shapes in both API Routes and Server Actions.
- Database Operations: All queries and updates operations should be written in `lib/db/queries.ts` and later import by api endpoint to consume
- Key Endpoints: Remember `/api/chat`, `/api/files/upload`, `/api/history`, etc. refer relevant `app/(chat)/api/route.ts for existing parttern
