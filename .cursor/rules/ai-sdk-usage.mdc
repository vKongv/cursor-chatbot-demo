## Vercel AI SDK Usage

- Core Packages: `ai` and `@ai-sdk/react`.
- Client Hooks: Use `@ai-sdk/react` hooks like `useChat` and `useCompletion` for managing client-side state and streaming responses.
- Backend: Implement API routes (e.g., `app/(chat)/api/chat/route.ts`) or Server Actions to interact with the AI SDK core (`ai` package).
- Models: Configure AI models (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) in `lib/ai/models.ts`.
- Tools: Define custom AI tools (functions the AI can call) in `lib/ai/tools/`. Ensure tools have clear descriptions and use Zod schemas for parameters.
- Streaming: Leverage built-in streaming capabilities for text and UI generation.
- Structured Output: Use the SDK features for generating structured objects (e.g., with Zod schemas).
