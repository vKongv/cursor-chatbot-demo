## Auth.js v5 Configuration

- Version: Auth.js v5 (formerly NextAuth.js)
- Core Config: Located in `app/(auth)/auth.ts` (or similar central auth file). Defines providers (e.g., Credentials), callbacks, session strategy, etc.
- API Routes: Auth.js handles routes under `/api/auth/*` automatically.
- Middleware: `middleware.ts` likely uses Auth.js helpers (`auth`) to protect routes and manage sessions.
- Session Access: Access session data on the server using the `auth()` helper and on the client using `useSession` hook or similar patterns with SessionProvider.
- Providers: Currently uses Credentials provider. Check config for others.
