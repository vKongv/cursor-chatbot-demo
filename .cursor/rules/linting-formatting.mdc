## Code Style & Formatting

- Tools: BiomeJS (`biome.jsonc`) and ESLint (`.eslintrc.json`) are used for linting and formatting.
- Compliance: Ensure code adheres to the configured rules.
- Automation: Formatting (including Tailwind class sorting) should be applied automatically (e.g., on save via editor integration or via `pnpm format` script).
- Scripts: Use `pnpm lint` and `pnpm format` for checks and fixes.
