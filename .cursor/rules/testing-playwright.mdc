## E2E Testing with Playwright

- Framework: Playwright (`@playwright/test`)
- Location: Tests are in `tests/e2e/`.
- Page Objects: Use Page Object Model (POM) pattern. Define page objects in `tests/pages/`.
- Configuration: `playwright.config.ts` defines browsers, base URL, etc.
- Execution: Run tests via `pnpm test`. Requires `PLAYWRIGHT=True` environment variable to be set.
- Selectors: Prefer user-visible locators (role, text, placeholder) over CSS/XPath where possible.
- DO NOT create or update test
